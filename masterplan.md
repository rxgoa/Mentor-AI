# AI Mentor App Masterplan

## 1. App Overview and Objectives
The AI Mentor App is a personalized mentoring tool designed to support a software engineer in exploring new ideas, learning, and personal growth. It uses advanced language models to analyze user input, categorize information, and provide context-aware responses. The app also features proactive monitoring to offer timely support and guidance.

### Key Objectives:
- Provide personalized mentoring across various domains (career development, personal growth, academic mentoring)
- Offer a sarcastic yet smart AI personality that engages the user effectively
- Implement a system for categorizing and storing relevant information
- Develop a proactive monitoring system to support the user's goals

## 2. Target Audience
Primary user: A software engineer (the developer) looking to create new things and learn.

## 3. Core Features and Functionality
1. User Input Analysis
   - Analyze user input to identify relevant information
   - Use Groq and Llama 3 8B model for processing

2. Information Classification
   - Categorize relevant information into:
     - Short Term Goals
     - Medium Term Goals
     - Long Term Goals
     - Tasks
     - Accountability
     - User Attributes

3. Memory Storage and Retrieval
   - Store categorized information in a local database (JSON format)
   - Retrieve relevant context for generating responses

4. Response Generation
   - Generate context-aware responses using the Llama 3 8B model
   - Implement a sarcastic, smart, and non-patronizing AI personality

5. Proactive Monitoring
   - Monitor user's daily activity and goals
   - Provide proactive support and check-ins between 9 AM and 5 PM

6. User Feedback Integration
   - Incorporate user feedback to improve responses and recommendations

## 4. High-level Technical Stack
- Frontend: React with Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Python with FastAPI
- Database: Local JSON document store
- LLM: Groq with Llama 3 8B model
- Framework: dspy for LLM configurations

## 5. Conceptual Data Model
- User Input
- Categorized Information (Short/Medium/Long Term Goals, Tasks, Accountability, User Attributes)
- Context Data
- User Feedback

## 6. User Interface Design Principles
- Clean and intuitive chat interface
- Easy navigation between different types of information
- Clear distinction between user input and AI responses
- Accessible feedback mechanism

## 7. Security Considerations
- As the app runs locally, focus on securing local data storage
- Implement basic authentication for app access

## 8. Development Phases
Phase 1: MVP Development
1. Set up the basic frontend and backend structure
2. Implement user input analysis and information classification
3. Develop the local database for storing categorized information
4. Create the response generation system with basic context retrieval
5. Implement a simple proactive monitoring system

Phase 2: Refinement and Feature Expansion
1. Enhance the AI personality and response quality
2. Improve the proactive monitoring system
3. Implement user feedback integration
4. Refine the information classification system

Phase 3: Testing and Optimization
1. Conduct thorough testing of all features
2. Optimize performance and response times
3. Refine the user interface based on usage patterns

## 9. Potential Challenges and Solutions
1. Challenge: Balancing the sarcastic personality with helpful mentoring
   Solution: Iterative testing and refinement of the response generation system

2. Challenge: Effective context retrieval from growing data
   Solution: Implement efficient indexing and search algorithms

3. Challenge: Maintaining app responsiveness with local processing
   Solution: Optimize LLM usage and consider background processing for non-critical tasks

## 10. Future Expansion Possibilities
1. Implement multi-user support
2. Develop mobile app version
3. Integrate with external tools and APIs for enhanced functionality
4. Implement advanced data analytics for tracking personal growth and goal achievement
5. Explore cloud-based deployment options for improved scalability
