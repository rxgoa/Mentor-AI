Strategy:

what?
i need to redo my handmand examples and synthetic generation code to mirror my new data from knowledge_module.
It changed, so now we need to change it too.

why?
we're having problems trying to identify changes in memories for complex data.
Its working only for creating a memory and updating details.
its not working for deleting a memory or even deleting specific details without any weird new details mentioning the old one.

expected result:
We need to run our trainer without any previous json file to load from, so  that we create new ones.
We should expect the output JSON file to reflect our new data structure

if works?
awesome! than we start testing and then finally keep going with the project.

if it doesnt work?
well.. then i should reach out to the discord channel and ask wtf is going on.
We should probably upload a simple project showing our data/trainer/module/signatures.
