# AI Mentor App TODO List

## High Priority
1. [x] Create a dataset of example inputs and outputs for training KnowledgeMaster.
1. [x] Implement a new signature for `knowledge_master`.
2. [ ] Add delete detail of memory functionality for memories in the `knowledge_modifier_node`
3. [ ] Implement pre-compilation strategy for dspy modules to improve performance
1. [ ] Implement response generation logic in the `response_generator_node`
2. [x] Add delete functionality for memories in the `knowledge_modifier_node`
4. [ ] Add more robust error handling, especially around API calls and data processing

## Medium Priority
5. [ ] Develop a more advanced memory retrieval system for better context in responses
6. [ ] Improve natural language processing for better relevance detection and knowledge extraction
7. [ ] Implement proper logging system instead of using print statements
8. [ ] Move configuration variables (like API keys) to a separate configuration file
9. [ ] Add unit tests for individual modules

## KnowledgeMaster Optimization
10. [ ] Simplify the docstring for KnowledgeMasterSignature while retaining essential instructions
11. [ ] Investigate and implement @dspy.Predict for breaking down complex tasks in KnowledgeMaster
12.
13. [ ] Implement and test a trained version of KnowledgeMaster using dspy's training capabilities
14. [ ] Compare performance of original vs. optimized KnowledgeMaster and adjust as needed

## Low Priority
15. [ ] Develop a user interface (web interface using Flask or FastAPI) for easier interaction
16. [ ] Implement the proactive monitoring system as described in the masterplan
17. [ ] Refine the AI personality to be more sarcastic yet smart, as per the app objectives

## Future Enhancements
18. [ ] Implement multi-user support
19. [ ] Develop a mobile app version
20. [ ] Integrate with external tools and APIs for enhanced functionality
21. [ ] Implement advanced data analytics for tracking personal growth and goal achievement
22. [ ] Explore cloud-based deployment options for improved scalability

## Ongoing Tasks
- [ ] Continuously refine and improve the knowledge classification system
- [ ] Regularly update and maintain the local database (JSON document store)
- [ ] Keep the LLM (Groq with Llama 3 8B model) up-to-date with the latest versions

Remember to prioritize these tasks based on your immediate needs and the project's current stage. You can modify this list as you progress and new requirements emerge.
